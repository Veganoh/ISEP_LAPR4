# 1. Requisites

**As Sales Clerk, I want to create a new products order on behalf of a given customer.**

Acceptance Criteria:

- The order must be paid at the time of creation.


- The customer must be notified of the new order. 

Client Clarifications:

- **Q1:** Does the customer (client) need to have an address when creating? Or initially this field may be empty and only need address when it requests a purchase.

    **A:** Regarding customers, the minimum required information is its name, a valid Value-Added Tax (VAT) identifier, an email address, and a phone number.


- **Q2:** How will the customer pay for the order placed by the clerk. Will receive a notification?

  **A:** For now, you may assume the clerk selects one of the available payment methods and types the required information. Yet, I would like to emphasise what is stated in the specifications document:

  *"While developing the system prototype, these two issues (i.e.: shipment and payment) must be considered. Although, since both are not perceived as representing a risk to the project, the shipment cost computation, and the connections to external systems (e.g.: carriers and payment services) should be mock."* 


- **Q3:** After placing the order will the system notify the customer? If so, how?

  **A:** That is a good idea... the system might send a notification email to the customer. This functionality will be seen as an asset to distinguish the solutions presented by different development teams.


- **Q4:** How do you want the clerk to select the products? By putting their id or selecting?

  **A:** Both: by typing the product id when knowing it or by using searching/browsing the products catalog (US1002).


- **Q5:** when a sales clerk creates a new order for a given customer, does the customer need to be registered in the system?

  **A:** Most of the times, the customer is already registered. However, it might happen (s)he is not registered. In such case, the customer is registered on that moment using US1003.

## 3.3. Applied Patterns

For the realization of this user story The team used an OOP approach taking into the account of the use of a persistence context through jpa.

## 3.4. Tests

**Test 1:** Verify that an exception is thrown when an Order is created in an invalid state.

    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        new Order(testCustomer, testShippingAddress, testBillingAddress);
    });
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        new Order(null, testBillingAddress, testShippingAddress);
    });
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        new Order(testCustomer, null, null);
    });

**Test 2:** Verify that a valid OrderLineItem is able to be added to an Order.
    
    Order order = new Order(testCustomer, testBillingAddress, testShippingAddress);
  
    Product product1 = generateDummyProduct(1);
    Quantity quantity1 = Quantity.valueOf(2);
  
    String line1 = order.addOrderLineItem(product1, quantity1).toString();
    String expected1 = "LINE NO: 1 |  PRODUCT: testShortDescription1 - testLongDescription1 | testBrand1\n" +
            "Ref.: ABCD.00001 / testReferenceCode1 | PVP 1,50\u00a0€ (1,85\u00a0€ w/Tax)  |  QTY: 2  |  TOTAL: 3,00\u00a0€";
  
    assertEquals(line1, expected1);
    
    (...)
    
    assertEquals(order.numberOfLines(), 2);

**Test 3:** Verify that an exception is thrown when an OrderLineItem is created in an invalid state.

    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        OrderLineItem item4 = new OrderLineItem(-1, generateDummyProduct(1));
    });
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        OrderLineItem item5 = new OrderLineItem(1, null);
    });
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
        OrderLineItem item6 = new OrderLineItem(1, generateDummyProduct(1), null);
    });


# 4. Implementation

**Class conformity** 

***Order***

    @Entity
    @Table(name = "Customer_Order")
    public class Order implements AggregateRoot<Long> {

            return repo.save(order);
        }
        
        (...)

    }


# 5. Integration/Demonstration

In order to integrate this US with the system at hand there was a need to create two classes of persistence so that it can be done through either a server or in memory.
Also, The UI was done in way that it can be easily implemented with other user should that need come.

# 6. Observations

This US is still in early development and will be improved in further sprints, namely with the development of features such as:
- Payment System mocking
- Shipment System mocking
- Order State control and switching

# US5001
=======================================


# 1. Requisites

**US5001** As Project Manager, I want that the team start developing the input communication module of the AGV digital twin to accept requests from the "AGVManager".

Acceptance Criteria:

- It must be used the provided application protocol (SPOMS2022).

- It is suggested the adopting of concurrent mechanisms (e.g. threads) and state sharing between these mechanisms.

- In this sprint, for demonstration purposes, it is acceptable to mock processing some of the incoming requests to foster some output communication


Client Clarifications:

- [A1](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=16437#p21096): For all of those US, the communication between the two involved components must be implemented in accordance with the SPOMS2022. The requests processing can be somehow mocked. For instance, if processing a request implies saving some data to the database, the component can instead write such data to a log (mocking). Latter, on next sprint, the teams implement the interaction to the database.
However, it is not advisable mocking everything, namely the components (internal) state. Notice that by mocking you are letting extra effort to the next sprint.
Finally, all US must be demonstrable.

These are the domain entities that are going to be used by this function.

As can be seen only one aggregate will be used in this functionality

## 3.3. Applied Patterns

For the realization of this user story The team used an aproach that allows internet connectivity between defferent servers that house key programs that take care of requests.
The use of TCP connections as well as the SPOMS protocol to make sure the data sent is wwell handled.

## 3.4. Tests

This user story does not interact directly with any user and the use case that it is taking care of is called by other userStories, 
As such there are no possible tests that can be made as all this user story does requires 2 different programs to be running in different servers.


# 4. Implementation





# 5. Integration/Demonstration

A client class was created in the AGVManagerServer application in order to request a use case from the agv twin server. This functionality does not work on it's own and must be called by another use case like a FIFO algoryth or a user request
A server class was started in the AGV twin server that handles the requests that come its way.


# 6. Observations
This user story simply sends the information of an agv to the server of agv twins as such it does not have any application on its own and must be called ny other user stories

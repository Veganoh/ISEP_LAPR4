# 1. Requisites

**US1900** As Project Manager, I intend that, for demonstration purposes, the system has the possibility of 
being initialized (bootstrap) with some information related to the product catalog and auxiliary 
information (e.g., categories of products).

Since this user story involves developing a bootstrap the team decided that there was no need to make
detailed documentation since it is an extra user story used for demonstration purposes only.
